<center> <h1>Project Beta-Lactamase</h1> </center>

This is the project inspired from [Data Professor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8e2g4IWQqK71bbzGDEI4Q) sir, from this [Call of Papers video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GtEgiWWyK4), and I started to contruibute with all my approaches. This project is very much interestng as this is related to bio-informatics, as well as machine learning. Being a aspirant in Graph ML in generals and GNNs in particular, I wanted to contribute in this project based on all my approaches. The whole structure of the project is look like this:

Beta Lactamase 
          |
          |______ IPYNB
          |______ code
          |_______ Data Professor's Dir
```

In the `IPYNB` dir there will all my approaches, from feature engineering to building the whole pipeline in doing the regression tasks of predicting the pchembl_value as well as  several SSL tasks and generative tasks. Those tasks include mainly genetative tasks of molecules geneations as well as downstream tasks of node classification, Graph Clustering, etc. The `code` dir contains the finalised tasks based on approaches made in the IPYNB files. and `Data Professor's` dir, is the dir that contains the starter files and data as per his video. 


## Updates of work done till now:

Till now, the changes commited and made now is the analysis of the data provided by sir, and done a complete analysis of those. And as that is completed, now
tha main tasks is to organize the unstable data with Graph Augmentations.

## Works doing now for future commits:

1. Using Graph augmentations, to create random relative structural changes of the graphs, for more data.
2. Using those data to create some starter approaches to perform the main task of regression, i.e. calculating the pchembl_value values.
3. Doing some further researches on SSL approaches, as well some downstream tasks followed by generative modellings.
